# Udacity Self Driving Cars
This repository contains the projects done in Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree

## Projects Outline

### Project 1: Finding Lane line (keywords: computer vision, OpenCV)
**Summary**: Using OpenCV image analysis, including image masking, Canny edge detection, and Hough Transform, to detect lane lines in a video stream. 

### Project 2: Advanced Lane Finding (keywords: computer vision, OpenCV)
**Summary**: Built an advanced lane-finding algorithm by implementing the lane detection on the processed video frames applied with distortion correction, colors and gradients thresholding, and perspective transform with OpenCV. The lane curvature and vehicle displacement are also identified.

### Project 3: Traffic Sign Classifier (keywords: convolutional neural networks, computer vision, DCGAN, TensorFlow)
**Summary**: Built and trained convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. Implement a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) to generated fake images for the imbalanced dataset.
